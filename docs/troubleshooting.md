# Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error when doing the migration that looks like:

```
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1005 Can't create table 'laravelbootstrapstarter.#sql-42c_f8' (errno: 150)
    (SQL: alter table `role_user` add constraint role_user_user_id_foreign foreign key (`user_id`)
    references `users` (`id`)) (Bindings: array ())
```

Then it's likely that the `id` column in your user table does not match the `user_id` column in `role_user`.
Make sure both are `INT(10)`.

When trying to use the LumineerUserTrait methods, you encounter the error which looks like

    Class name must be a valid object or a string

then probably you don't have published Lumineer assets or something went wrong when you did it.
First of all check that you have the `Lumineer.php` file in your `app/config` directory.
If you don't, then try `php artisan vendor:publish` and, if it does not appear, manually copy the `/vendor/Peaches/Lumineer/src/config/config.php` file in your config directory and rename it `Lumineer.php`.
